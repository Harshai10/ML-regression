# Linear_Regression_Python
Python 2.7 implementation of Linear_Regression for Machine Learning

This is a simple Python implemenatation of Linear Regression for the sample dataset taken from Internt. The dataset is very simple with one single feature and a target (X and Y) however I tried to implement both linear regression and polynomial regression. Explanataion of the regression process is commented in the code itself.

## Polynomial Regression
I've tried fitting polynomial regression for the same data just for comparison and learning and below are the plots
